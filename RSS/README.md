### Notes

 1. The example usage of this code is demonstrated in:
	```matlab
    >> DEMO
	```

 2. This code reads the input color image from the subfolder `Image` in each dataset folder, and generates three resulting subfolders:
	 1. `StaMaps`  stability maps
	 2. `SalMaps`  saliency maps
	 3. `RSS`  detection results, including .mat and .png

 3. For each input color image, the resulting MAT file is a structure array "Targets" with the following fields:
	 1. `RegionNums`  the number of the detected small targets
	 2. `Regions`  a structure array with the regional properties of the detected small targets
		 1. `ClusterNo`  the cluster ID of a target
		 2. `Props`  three regional properties of a target: Boundary, Pixel List, and Bounding Box
