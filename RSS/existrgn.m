function [hasRgn,bw] = existrgn(gray,threshold)
%EXISTRGN converts a gray-scale image GRAY to a binary image BW by exploiting THRESHOLD, 
% and checks whether BW contains foreground regions.

bw = im2bw(gray,threshold);
bw = imcomplement(bw);
bw = imfill(bw,'holes');
tmpBoundaries = bwboundaries(bw);

if size(tmpBoundaries,1) >= 1
	hasRgn = true;
else
	hasRgn = false;
end
